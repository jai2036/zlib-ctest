* [zlib & resources](https://zlib.net/)


**Pre-requisites**
1. Install docker
2. git clone <current repository>

**How to run**
Go to zlib-ctest (src dir) and run following commands

Build docker image with: `docker build -t app .`
You can then start the image in a new container with:  `docker run --rm app`

Which will provide you following output:
```
 zlib-ctest  →► docker run app
Initial size: 100
Compressed size: 21
Uncompressed size: 100
Great Success
```

Have fun!
